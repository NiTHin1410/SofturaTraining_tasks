<h3>
The Evolution
of Speed
</h3>
<p><i>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
With the 2022 version, the Panigale V4 project completes the most significant evolution since its birth. The improvements involve all areas: aerodynamics, ergonomics, engine, chassis and electronics. The result is an even faster bike on the racetrack and at the same time more intuitive and less tiring for a wide range of riders. In short, it offers great and rewarding excitement to pro-rider and amateur alike.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEven the look of the bike has been revamped, with a further dose of aggressive flavour. The unprecedented graphic design conceived by the Ducati Centro Stile includes the black color for the logos applied to the full red fairings, the double fabric saddle (two-tone on the S version) and, again for the S version, the red tag on the black rims.</li>
