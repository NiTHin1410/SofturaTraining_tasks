<p><ol><li><i>&nbsp&nbsp<b><big>S</big>hawarma</b> refers to the Middle Eastern method cooking where thin slices of meat, most traditionally lamb, are stack on a vertical spit and slowly rotate in front of a fire or other heat source. The outside meat is slowly cooked and then shaved off to serve.</i><b> It's a common street food and the result is tender, juicy, well spiced meat.</b></li>
</br>
<p><li><i>&nbspOur version, since it's cooked in the oven, varies greatly from traditional shawarma, but mimics the flavor and tenderness you would find and makes it possible to make at home.  Shawarma refers to the meat and is most commonly served with pita and veggies like lettuce, onions, and tomatoes. Use the chicken in a salad, on a pita, or over rice. However you serve it, you're going to love it. Cooking the chicken with the onions adds extra moisture to the pan and helps it further tenderize the chicken and produces some pan sauce that is great tossed in with <tt>the cut chicken!</tt>

<h3><b><u>HOW TO MAKE SHAWARMA</u></b></h3>
<br/><p>
<b>STEP 1:</b>&nbspShawarma is one of the most famous meat delicacy, which can be prepared at home by following some simple steps given below. Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. In the meantime, wash the chicken and drain excess water from the chicken pieces. Once, the chicken is moist, itâ€™s time to prepare the marinade
<br/>
<br/>
<b>STEP 2:</b>&nbspTake a bowl and combine all the ingredients for marination. You can add your own choice of spices to make this dish even more delicious. Once the mixture is ready, rub it on the chicken pieces. To spread it properly, you can use your hands rather than using a spoon.
<br/>
</br>
<b>STEP 3:</b>&nbspTo prepare the sauce, combine yogurt with sesame paste, salt, garlic and mix well using a whipper. Then, barbecue the chicken strips until they are well cooked. If you are fond of the smoky flavours you can grill the chicken till it turns golden.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>SREP 4:</b>&nbspOnce done take pita bread and layer it with the sauce. Add pickled vegetable, cooked chicken and spread evenly on the bread. Now roll it or slice the pita bread with precision so that no rough edges remain. Serve the shawarma with green chutney and yoghurt sauce.You can also serve with a cheesy mayo.
